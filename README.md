# Library_management_system

This is a simple console-based Library Management System developed in Java using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as class, object, encapsulation, and abstraction.

It allows a librarian to:

View all books in the library

View all registered users

Issue a book to a user

Accept a book return from a user

# The application uses three main classes:

Book: represents each book's details and issue status

User: represents library members and their borrowed books

Library: manages books and users, handles issue/return logic
